YaComponent
===========

YaComponent is a framework for handling components and the interfaces of components.
YaComponent includes
 * XML description to define components, deployment and interfaces
 * Interface definition is done with google protobuf
 * perl base generator for c++ code for components and interfaces
 * implementation of the publish/subscriper pattern by using [crossroads-io](http://www.crossroads.io/)

Status
------

Currently development of the generator started, but still not usable. The documentation growed by adding some
simple PlantUML design views.
